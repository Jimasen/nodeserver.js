This is a project that involves multiple components. You need something that can act like a REST API server that listens to HTTP requests and responds accordingly. You also need something to fetch a URL and take a screenshot like a normal web browser. There is also a logic in it that depends on whether an email address is provided; the output can be an image file returned, or an email with an attachment is sent out.
1.Set up a new Node.js project and initialize it using npm:
2. Install the necessary packages. You’ll need express for the API server, puppeteer for capturing screenshots, and nodemailer for sending emails:
3. Create an index.js file and set up the basic server using Express:
4. Inside the /screenshot route, use Puppeteer to capture the web page screenshot and handle the response accordingly:
5. To handle sending emails with the screenshot attachment, add the following code inside the if (email) block:
Make sure to replace 'your-email-service-provider', 'your-email@example.com', and 'your-email-password' with your actual email service provider’s details.
6. Finally, start the server:

node index.js
Now, when you make a GET request to http://localhost:3000/screenshot?url={URL}, the server will capture a screenshot of the provided URL. If an email address is also provided as email={EMAIL}, the server will send the screenshot as an email attachment instead of returning it directly.

Remember to handle errors and add any necessary error checking or validation based on your requirements.

That’s it! You now have a basic REST API server that captures web page screenshots and optionally sends them via email. Feel free to enhance it further according to your needs.
